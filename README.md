To set up `neomutt`, you will need to add accounts in the `$HOME/.neomutt/accounts/` directory.
There are templates for gmail and office365 in `mail/neomutt/templates`.

Once you have added your accounts, follow the example in `mail/neomutt/account_setup.example` and 
create an `account_setup` file in `$HOME/.neomutt/`.
